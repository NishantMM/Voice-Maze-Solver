# Voice-Maze-Solver
This project uses offline speech recognition to navigate a procedurally generated maze. Instead of a keyboard, players use real-time voice commands ("up", "down", "left", "right") to control a red ball and reach the goal. It features a command queue for fluid movement and local audio processing for low latency.
